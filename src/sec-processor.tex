\fixme{I have some stuff from Mike and I know enough about this to write
  this up. Don't forget to list these assembly tests.}

UC Berkeley has a folder called isa inside riscv-tests, with:

rv32ui - 32-bit user-level, integer-only
rv32si - 32-bit supervisor-level, integer-only
rv64ui - 64-bit user-level, integer only
rv64uf - 64-bit user-level, integer and floating-point
rv64uv - 64-bit user-level, integer, floating-point, and vector
rv64si - 64-bit supervisor-level, integer only
rv64sv - 64-bit supervisor-level, integer and vector

These folders have programs that exercise one-instruction or one-feature of
the rocket-chip. For example, one add.S program test the add instruction
15-times under different inputs.
