\section{Preliminary Subsystem Tape-Outs}

To validate many of the components that we have created, we have done two
TSMC 180nm tapeouts. The first was a design that contained the BSG
Commlink, a BSG Tag chain, and a fully digital clock generators that were
configured by the BSG Tag unit. This goal of this tapeout was validation
of both the BSG Commlink and BSG Tag as well as all the BSG IP cores that
we used to compose these two components. Both the BSG Commlink and BSG
Tag are source-synchronous and therefore require strict timing
constraints to work. The second tapeout was the same as the first with
the addition of a 10-core Manycore. Building on the first tapeout, the
goal of the second tapeout was further validation on the BSG IP core
library as well as validation of the BSG Manycore design.
